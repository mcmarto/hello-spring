# hello-spring

This project started from the Spring Boot documentation - specifically the section title [Developing your first Spring Boot Application](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-first-application.html).  Its purpose is to give me some experience of working with git (locally and via GitHub) and to provide a small application to allow me to experiment with and to learn about related topics. 

The application is a very simple Spring Boot web application which does nothing other than print "Hello World" to the browser.
